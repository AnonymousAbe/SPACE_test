Hello

Lets put some ideas here for what we want this to be.  



/**********************************/
       STORY
/**********************************/

Ahh Space, the Final Frontier.  Is space cool?  What's out there?  Let's find out.




/**********************************/
       GAME MECHANICS
/**********************************/

"My Cold Iron Longsword deals 1d6 + 6 damage and it can't be reduced!"  What kind 
of rules should we have?  How does combat work?  Or non-combat encounters?




/**********************************/
       Game Structure
/**********************************/

How are we even going to do this?  It'll be easy, let's decide what language we
want to use (C vs C++?) and how the game engine will run.  Right now the code
I have in here is just to refresh my memory of C++ and C code.  We could structure
the game totally differently.  There are also some online tutorials that already
have C classes setup for any generic text-based adventure game we might want to
get ideas from.

Aside from how to create items, monsters, traps, SPACESHIPS! we will also need
a way to interface with the player to make it seem like they have many options.
What kind of options do you think are important?
